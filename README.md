# Statistic Calculator

## Instruction and notes:
Please run the whole cell in the main script, and the calculator should start operating.
I used the isnumeric() method to check for whether the characters in the string of inputs are numbers or not to account for errors.
  I have accounted for incorrect inputs (meaning didn't enter numbers or 'done') in the user_input and incorrect numbers when picking computational options.
